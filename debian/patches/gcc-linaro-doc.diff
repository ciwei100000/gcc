+Sometimes when there are only a few combinations are required, it would
+be a big effort to come up with a @code{MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS} list to
+cover all undesired ones.  In such a case, just listing all the required
+combinations in @code{MULTILIB_REQUIRED} would be more straightforward.
+
+The way to specify the entries in @code{MULTILIB_REQUIRED} is same with
+the way used for @code{MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS}, only this time what are
+required will be specified.  Suppose there are multiple sets of
+@code{MULTILIB_OPTIONS} and only two combinations are required, one
+for ARMv7-M and one for ARMv7-R with hard floating-point ABI and FPU, the
+@code{MULTILIB_REQUIRED} can be set to:

+@end smallexample
+
+The @code{MULTILIB_REQUIRED} can be used together with
+@code{MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS}.  The option combinations generated from

-The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
-functional and useful document \fIfree\fR in the sense of freedom: to
-assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
-with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
-Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
-to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
-for modifications made by others.
-.Sp
-This License is a kind of \*(L"copyleft\*(R", which means that derivative
-works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
-complements the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License, which is a copyleft
-license designed for free software.
-.Sp
-We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
-software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
-program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
-software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
-it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
-whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
-principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
-.IP "1." 4
-.IX Item "1."
-\&\s-1APPLICABILITY\s0 \s-1AND\s0 \s-1DEFINITIONS\s0
-.Sp
-This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
-contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
-distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
-world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
-work under the conditions stated herein.  The \*(L"Document\*(R", below,
-refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
-licensee, and is addressed as \*(L"you\*(R".  You accept the license if you
-copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
-under copyright law.
-.Sp
-A \*(L"Modified Version\*(R" of the Document means any work containing the
-Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
-modifications and/or translated into another language.
-.Sp
-A \*(L"Secondary Section\*(R" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
-of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
-publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
-subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
-directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
-part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
-any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
-connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
-commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
-them.
-.Sp
-The \*(L"Invariant Sections\*(R" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
-are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
-that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
-section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
-allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
-Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
-Sections then there are none.
-.Sp
-The \*(L"Cover Texts\*(R" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
-as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
-the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
-be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
-.Sp
-A \*(L"Transparent\*(R" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
-represented in a format whose specification is available to the
-general public, that is suitable for revising the document
-straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
-pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
-drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
-for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
-to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
-format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
-or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
-An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
-of text.  A copy that is not \*(L"Transparent\*(R" is called \*(L"Opaque\*(R".
-.Sp
-Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
-\&\s-1ASCII\s0 without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
-format, \s-1SGML\s0 or \s-1XML\s0 using a publicly available
-\&\s-1DTD\s0, and standard-conforming simple \s-1HTML\s0,
-PostScript or \s-1PDF\s0 designed for human modification.  Examples
-of transparent image formats include \s-1PNG\s0, \s-1XCF\s0 and
-\&\s-1JPG\s0.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
-read and edited only by proprietary word processors, \s-1SGML\s0 or
-\&\s-1XML\s0 for which the \s-1DTD\s0 and/or processing tools are
-not generally available, and the machine-generated \s-1HTML\s0,
-PostScript or \s-1PDF\s0 produced by some word processors for
-output purposes only.
-.Sp
-The \*(L"Title Page\*(R" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
-plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
-this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
-formats which do not have any title page as such, \*(L"Title Page\*(R" means
-the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
-preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
-.Sp
-The \*(L"publisher\*(R" means any person or entity that distributes copies
-of the Document to the public.
-.Sp
-A section \*(L"Entitled \s-1XYZ\s0\*(R" means a named subunit of the Document whose
-title either is precisely \s-1XYZ\s0 or contains \s-1XYZ\s0 in parentheses following
-text that translates \s-1XYZ\s0 in another language.  (Here \s-1XYZ\s0 stands for a
-specific section name mentioned below, such as \*(L"Acknowledgements\*(R",
-\&\*(L"Dedications\*(R", \*(L"Endorsements\*(R", or \*(L"History\*(R".)  To \*(L"Preserve the Title\*(R"
-of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
-section \*(L"Entitled \s-1XYZ\s0\*(R" according to this definition.
-.Sp
-The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
-states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
-Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
-License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
-implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
-no effect on the meaning of this License.
-.IP "2." 4
-.IX Item "2."
-\&\s-1VERBATIM\s0 \s-1COPYING\s0
-.Sp
-You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
-commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
-copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
-to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
-conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
-technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
-copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
-compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
-number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
-.Sp
-You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
-you may publicly display copies.
-.IP "3." 4
-.IX Item "3."
-\&\s-1COPYING\s0 \s-1IN\s0 \s-1QUANTITY\s0
-.Sp
-If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
-printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
-Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
-copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
-Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
-the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
-you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
-the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
-visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
-Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
-the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
-as verbatim copying in other respects.
-.Sp
-If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
-legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
-reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
-pages.
-.Sp
-If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
-more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
-copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
-a computer-network location from which the general network-using
-public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
-a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
-If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
-when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
-that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
-location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
-Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
-edition to the public.
-.Sp
-It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
-Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
-them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
-.IP "4." 4
-.IX Item "4."
-\&\s-1MODIFICATIONS\s0
-.Sp
-You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
-the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
-the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
-Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
-and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
-of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
-.RS 4
-.IP "A." 4
-.IX Item "A."
-Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
-from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
-(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
-of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
-if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
-.IP "B." 4
-.IX Item "B."
-List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
-responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
-Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
-Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
-unless they release you from this requirement.
-.IP "C." 4
-.IX Item "C."
-State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
-Modified Version, as the publisher.
-.IP "D." 4
-.IX Item "D."
-Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
-.IP "E." 4
-.IX Item "E."
-Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
-adjacent to the other copyright notices.
-.IP "F." 4
-.IX Item "F."
-Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
-giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
-terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
-.IP "G." 4
-.IX Item "G."
-Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
-and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
-.IP "H." 4
-.IX Item "H."
-Include an unaltered copy of this License.
-.IP "I." 4
-.IX Item "I."
-Preserve the section Entitled \*(L"History\*(R", Preserve its Title, and add
-to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
-publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
-there is no section Entitled \*(L"History\*(R" in the Document, create one
-stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
-given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
-Version as stated in the previous sentence.
-.IP "J." 4
-.IX Item "J."
-Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
-public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
-the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
-it was based on.  These may be placed in the \*(L"History\*(R" section.
-You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
-least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
-publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
-.IP "K." 4
-.IX Item "K."
-For any section Entitled \*(L"Acknowledgements\*(R" or \*(L"Dedications\*(R", Preserve
-the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
-substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
-dedications given therein.
-.IP "L." 4
-.IX Item "L."
-Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
-unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
-or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
-.IP "M." 4
-.IX Item "M."
-Delete any section Entitled \*(L"Endorsements\*(R".  Such a section
-may not be included in the Modified Version.
-.IP "N." 4
-.IX Item "N."
-Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \*(L"Endorsements\*(R" or
-to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
-.IP "O." 4
-.IX Item "O."
-Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
-.RE
-.RS 4
-.Sp
-If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
-appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
-copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
-of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
-list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
-These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
-.Sp

+@findex define_int_iterator
+@findex define_int_attr
+
+Int iterators operate in a similar way to code iterators.  @xref{Code Iterators}.
+
+The construct:
+
+@smallexample
+(define_int_iterator @var{name} [(@var{int1} "@var{cond1}") @dots{} (@var{intn} "@var{condn}")])
+@end smallexample
+
+defines a pseudo integer constant @var{name} that can be instantiated as
+@var{inti} if condition @var{condi} is true.  Each @var{int}
+must have the same rtx format.  @xref{RTL Classes}. Int iterators can appear
+in only those rtx fields that have 'i' as the specifier. This means that
+each @var{int} has to be a constant defined using define_constant or
+define_c_enum.
+
+As with mode and code iterators, each pattern that uses @var{name} will be
+expanded @var{n} times, once with all uses of @var{name} replaced by
+@var{int1}, once with all uses replaced by @var{int2}, and so on.
+@xref{Defining Mode Iterators}.
+
+It is possible to define attributes for ints as well as for codes and modes.
+Attributes are defined using:
+
+@smallexample
+(define_int_attr @var{name} [(@var{int1} "@var{value1}") @dots{} (@var{intn} "@var{valuen}")])
+@end smallexample
+
+Here's an example of int iterators in action, taken from the ARM port:
+
+@smallexample
+(define_int_iterator QABSNEG [UNSPEC_VQABS UNSPEC_VQNEG])
+
+(define_int_attr absneg [(UNSPEC_VQABS "abs") (UNSPEC_VQNEG "neg")])
+
+(define_insn "neon_vq<absneg><mode>"
+  [(set (match_operand:VDQIW 0 "s_register_operand" "=w")
+	(unspec:VDQIW [(match_operand:VDQIW 1 "s_register_operand" "w")
+		       (match_operand:SI 2 "immediate_operand" "i")]
+		      QABSNEG))]
+  "TARGET_NEON"
+  "vq<absneg>.<V_s_elem>\t%<V_reg>0, %<V_reg>1"
+  [(set_attr "neon_type" "neon_vqneg_vqabs")]
+)
+
+@end smallexample
+
+This is equivalent to:
+
+@smallexample

+	(unspec:VDQIW [(match_operand:VDQIW 1 "s_register_operand" "w")
